## Mission

HackVillage bridges the gap between developers and stakeholders through **financial escrow**, **career-pathing**, and **high-speed feedback loops** that ensure every tech event delivers immediate and long-term value.

We are building the primary infrastructure for the African tech ecosystem — professionalizing the hackathon and tech event experience from the ground up.

---

## The Problem

| Pain Point | Traditional Hackathon | HackVillage |
|---|---|---|
| **Payment** | Weeks or months of waiting | 50% on the day, 50% on follow-up |
| **Outcome** | A trophy and a LinkedIn post | Internships, credits & verified portfolio |
| **Media** | Photos surface two weeks later | 48-hour high-res gallery delivery |
| **Engagement** | "Eat and go home" | Structured feedback & career pathing |

Organizers ghost winners. Submissions vanish into the void. Brilliant prototypes die on flash drives. HackVillage exists to fix all three.

---

## The HackVillage Standard

HackVillage enforces a **Developer Bill of Rights** and an **Organizer Performance Guarantee** through three non-negotiable pillars:

### 1. The Instant Reward Protocol
Organizers deposit **100% of the prize pool upfront** before an event goes live. Winners receive **50% instantly** on the day of the event; the remaining 50% is released automatically upon verified milestone completion. No escrow, no live event.

### 2. Developer Value Beyond the Prize
Every event builds a verifiable **Proof of Work** profile — win rates, GitHub contributions per event, and judge endorsements. Events are audition stages for real internships, apprenticeships, and mentorships brokered directly through the platform.

### 3. The Stakeholder Quality Guarantee
By enforcing professional standards and instant rewards, HackVillage attracts top-tier talent. Organizations receive **production-ready solutions** and **actionable data** — not polished pitches with no follow-through.

---

## How It Works

HackVillage operates as a three-phase engine:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Features

### A. Escrow & Payout Engine

- **Prize Vault** — A secure holding area for prize pools. Only events marked "Prize Verified" are permitted to go live on the platform.
- **Split Disbursement API** — Automated fund release via M-Pesa and bank APIs: 50% at win, 50% at milestone handover.
- **Public Ledger** — Every deposit and payout is recorded on a blockchain ledger and exposed via a public link, fulfilling the open-source integrity requirement.

### B. Proof of Work Portfolio

- **Dynamic Developer Profiles** — Searchable profiles displaying hackathon win rates, per-event GitHub contributions, and judge endorsements.
- **Project Gallery** — A permanent home for every submission with lifecycle status tags: `Demo`, `In-Production`, `Pivoted to Startup`.

### C. Career & Operational Excellence

- **One-Click Internship** — A tagging system for "Value Add-ons" that automates introductions between winners and hiring managers or HR teams.
- **48-Hour Media Vault** — Organizers must upload high-resolution event photos within 48 hours. Failure results in a **Trust Penalty** on their organizer score.
- **Automatic Feedback Loop** — Judges must submit a minimum of three structured feedback points per team before scores can be finalized.
- **Legacy Tracker** — Automated 3-month check-ins track whether prototypes have evolved into products, capturing the real-world impact of every event.

## Escrow & Payout Engine

The financial layer is the heart of Trust-as-a-Service and is held to a **90% Trust Score KPI** — meaning 90% of all prizes must be disbursed within one hour of event conclusion.

### Phase 1 — Fund Security (Setup)

```
Organizer                  Paystack              Smart Contract
    │                          │                       │
    │── Deposit 100% prize ───►│                       │
    │                          │── Confirm receipt ───►│
    │                          │                       │── Lock funds in
    │                          │                       │   Prize Vault state
    │◄── "Prize Verified" badge issued ────────────────│
```

1. The organizer transfers 100% of the prize pool via Paystack (card or bank).
2. The backend service records the deposit and triggers the smart contract.
3. The smart contract creates a verifiable ledger entry and locks funds in `PRIZE_VAULT` state.
4. The event is issued a **"Prize Verified"** badge and permitted to go live.

### Phase 2 — Split Disbursement (Closing)

```
Judging finalized
    │
    ▼
Backend Service ──── calls Smart Contract ──── authorizes 50% release
    │
    ▼
Paystack Split API ──── M-Pesa / Bank transfer ──── Winner receives funds
    │
    ▼
Public Ledger entry recorded
    │
    ▼  (organizer confirms handover)
Backend Service ──── calls Smart Contract ──── authorizes final 50%
    │
    ▼
Paystack API ──── Final transfer ──── Public Ledger entry recorded
```

### Error Handling & Compliance

- **Rollback Logic** — If a Paystack call fails or a network error occurs, funds remain locked in the vault until a successful transaction is confirmed. No partial or ambiguous states.
- **KYC / AML Compliance** — All large payouts comply with Central Bank of Kenya requirements via Paystack's verified compliance layer.
- **Idempotent Operations** — Every disbursement call is idempotent; duplicate triggers from retries cannot result in a double payout.

## Success Metrics

| KPI | Description | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **Trust Score** | % of prizes disbursed within 1 hour of event conclusion | > 90% |
| **Conversion Rate** | % of winners landing an interview or internship via the platform | Tracked per cohort |
| **Media Momentum** | Average time for event photos to be available post-event | < 48 hours |
| **Legacy Rate** | % of submitted prototypes that evolve into active products (3-month check-in) | Tracked per cohort |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- PostgreSQL >= 15
- A Paystack account (test keys sufficient for local development)

### Repository layout

The codebase is split so frontend and backend contributors can work in parallel:

```
HackVillage/
├── frontend/     # Next.js 14 App Router UI + PWA + Route Handlers
├── backend/      # Prisma/PostgreSQL, escrow & payout services, ledger stubs
├── tests/        # Unit tests (vitest)
└── LOCAL_SETUP.md # Fast local bootstrap notes
```

### Local bootstrap

For the fastest local run:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

The public pages and health endpoint should be available at http://localhost:3000.

If you want Prisma-backed seed data as well, ensure PostgreSQL is running and then:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

| Area | Docs |
|---|---|
| UI / PWA | [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md) |
| Data / escrow / payouts | [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) |
| Contributions | [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) |

Still a **single npm package** — install and run everything from the repo root.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Salamander-Tech-Hub/HackVillage.git
cd HackVillage
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root (see `.env.example`):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/hackvillage
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
RPC_URL=https://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Development

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed   # optional — demo organizer + Prize Verified event
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Useful scripts:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Next.js dev server (`./frontend`) |
| `npm run build` | Production build (enables PWA service worker) |
| `npm run db:migrate` / `db:seed` / `db:studio` | Prisma against `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` | CI-style checks |

### Progressive Web App

HackVillage is installable as a PWA (manifest + service worker). The service worker is **disabled in development** and generated on production builds — use `npm run build && npm start` to verify install / offline behavior (`/offline` fallback).

### Database

Prisma schema lives at `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and models events, escrow vaults, payouts, submissions, judging, and developer profiles.

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed   # optional — seeds demo events and profiles
```
